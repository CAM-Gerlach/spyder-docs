"there."

"Instead, just install `Miniconda`_ inside WSL2 and create a new conda "
"environment (or use an existing conda- or virtualenv), then install "
"Spyder-Kernels into that environment with e.g. ``conda install spyder-"

"``conda install ipython_genutils``."

" 1 GB of RAM, depending on how long you've been using it and how many "

"system with a dual-core or better x64 processor and at least 4 GB of RAM,"
" although 8 GB is *strongly* recommended for best performance when "
