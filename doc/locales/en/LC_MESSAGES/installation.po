"Spyder. For users needing Linux support, third-party Spyder plugins or "
"Variable Explorer compatibility with custom-installed packages—all "
"capabilities which the standalone installers currently do not yet "

"The standalone installers are our recommended method for most users on "
"Windows and macOS, with experimental Linux support under active "
"development. They work like any other IDE, where Spyder can be installed "
"and updated independently of the Python environments you use to run your "
"code. This avoids the problems with incompatible packages and broken "
"installations users often face when mixing Spyder with the (Conda, etc) "
"environments they use to run their code."
msgstr ""

#: ../../installation.rst:51
msgid ""
"The installers include a built-in Python environment with the most common"
" scientific libraries (e.g. NumPy, Pandas, Matpotlib, etc), which can be "
"used out of the box for basic data analysis tasks. However, to manage "
"your own packages and environments, you'll currently need to connect an "
"external Python distribution (such as `Anaconda`_, `Miniconda`_, "
"`Miniforge/Mambaforge`_, `WinPython`_ or `Python.org <Python_>`__) to "
"your standalone copy of Spyder. For more information on this, see our "

"\"Lite\" versions of both installers are also available from the "

"These lack a number of optional but recommended dependencies, such as "
"NumPy, SciPy and Pandas, meaning that a few "
":doc:`/panes/variableexplorer` features, including graphical data import "
"wizards and support for rich display and editing of NumPy arrays and "
"Pandas DataFrames, will not be available. Given this only saves a modest "
"amount of space while missing out on significant features, we recommend "
