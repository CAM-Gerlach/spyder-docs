## Overview

This repository contains the documentation for Spyder, the Scientific Python Development Environment.
You can view the live docs for current and past Spyder versions at [docs.Spyder-IDE.org](https://docs.spyder-ide.org).

For more information about Spyder itself, please see our [website](https://www.spyder-ide.org/) and the [main repo](https://github.com/spyder-ide/spyder).


## Building and Deploying

The docs are built with [Sphinx](http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/stable/index.html) and deployed with GitHub Actions to the [docs.Spyder-IDE.org](https://docs.spyder-ide.org/) domain.
The ``master`` branch contains the in-development docs for Spyder 4, while the ``3.x`` branch has the docs for the previous major version, Spyder 3.
